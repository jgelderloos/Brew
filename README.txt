Brew is a simple application for creating and saving beer recipes. It performs
basic calculations for the final product based on a number on input parameters
(grains, hops, boil time, batch size).

Currently this is pure Ruby source code.

Example.rb contains an example of how to create a brew recipe, calculate and 
output some important info, and save the brew recipe.
